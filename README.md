## Introduction - NextNest App

During my time at the Tech Academy I joined a team of developers building a suite of applications for a 2 week sprint. This was an apprenticeship done for [Prosper IT Consulting ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prosper-it-consulting/) where I participated in Agile/Scrum practices by completing user stories (as well as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint retrospective) to deliver a fully functional application on-time. I personally was tasked with creating an app that aggregates civic data to give clients more confidence when moving to a new place...

It is called ***NextNest***.

Having limited experience with Django's structure and syntax proved to be challenging at points but also rewarding. Having a heads-up attitude and solving problems in real-time gave me further confidence in my ability to overcome roadblocks and generate workable solutions. Not only did I successfully learn new material and deliver a completed product days ahead of schedule, but I gained hands-on project management and team programming skills that I know will be greatly benficial in the future.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets, and navigation links. I also have full code files in this repo for the larger functionalities that were implemented.
